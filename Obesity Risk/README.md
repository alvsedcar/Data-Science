# Multi-Class-Prediction-of-Obesity-Risk

## Introduction
This project delves into the obesity risk detection taking into account various features. An EDA takes place and different machine learning models are used in order to get a better prediction accuracy.

## Methodology and Repository content
1. Obesity_RF_FIMP: Jupyter notebook making use of Random Forest Classifier and delving into feature importance
2. Obesity_GB: Jupyter notebook making use of Gradient Boosting Classifier
3. Obesity_GB_GVS: Jupyter Notebook making use of Gradient Boosting Classifier and GVSearch to find the best hyperparameters
train.csv: training dataset used

## Results
Comparison of different models and techniques for obesity risk detection.
Enhanced prediction accuracy through feature engineering
